<h1>The First Burning Man</h1>
<p>In 1986, Larry Harvey and his friend Jerry James built an eight foot tall man out of scrap lumber. They hauled “the Man” to Baker Beach in San Francisco with a group of about a dozen friends, doused “the Man” with gasoline, and set it ablaze. This beach bonfire created a community which eventually became Burning Man. 
</p>
<p>After “the Man” was alight, other people on the beach came over to watch, nearly tripling the original group. The official attendance count for the first Burning Man was 35 people.</p>
<p>“...and before I knew it I looked over and there was a hippie with his pants on his head and a guitar standing there, materialized out of the murk. And he started singing a song about fire. Now I'm not exactly a hootenanny kind of guy, but it seemed like the thing to do, and we started singing.”¹
</p>
<p>At one point during the burn, a woman ran up to the Man, and grabbed his hand. This is known as the first spontaneous performance.

<h1>The Burn of 1990</h1>
<p>In 1990, the Golden Gate Park Police got wind of the event, and decreed that the event was a fire hazard to the surrounding hillside. The police agreed to let them erect the Man, but would not allow them to perform the burn.</p>
<p>The agreement not to burn the statue transformed the audience into an unhappy unruly mob, as Larry realized what had been a celebration had become, to the crowd, a “mere roadside attraction.” At that point Larry realized that Burning Man at Baker Beach had grown as much as it could in San Francisco, and one way or another, the statue and its celebration would have to appear somewhere else. Lowered and dismantled, the statue was put back in storage.</p>

<h1>Burning Man, 1991</h1>
<p>The move to the Black Rock Desert represented an epochal change. Survival camping was a challenge. In a very real sense, everyone perforce was a participant. A pilgrimage was now required to reach the home of Burning Man, and he resided in a hallowed space, a place apart and separate from the ordinary world. The desert had enlarged the scope of human struggle and intensified involvement. It had restored the spirit of Burning Man and the community that had grown around it. Most importantly, beneath its sentinel presence, a city had begun to form.</p>

<h1>The Rangers</h1>
<p> The first year of Burning Man on the Black Rock Desert was a small and intimate affair, but by 1992, I realized that there was an increasing need for a specialized group of seasoned burners who could navigate the desert, locate lost campers and bring them safely back to the community encampment. We took the name "Rangers", a term which predates American Revolutionary War when civilian volunteers "ranged" the frontier line of farms and homesteads primarily to protect settlers. The role of the Rangers has changed and grown at the same time, but the original purpose still holds true; Helping lost souls. And being a Ranger has become an art.

<h1>The Man</h1>
<p>The large wooden effigy - referred to fondly as the Man - is recognized around the world as the icon of Burning Man. Situated at what has been referred to as the axis mundl of Black Rock City, the Man sculpture is elevated and visible from all corners of the community.</p>
<p>According to the Burning Man orginization, "The figure represents nothing expressed or explicaple, yet it is a physical and ethical guidepost..during at least one week of the year." The fire rituals and performances associated with burning the Man during the final days of the gathering.</p>
<p>For twenty years, Crimson Rose has returned to the site of the Man on the morning following the burn to collect whatever remnants and relics remain. Twisted metal, melted neon, bent nails, and ashes sift through her hansa and find their way into her glass collection jars. Mystery draws her to the remains each year: "I have a fascination with the ever-evolving question, what will be found this year and what will be lost to the fire? I am the archeologist, searching for the transmuted treasures of history...drawn to a location where the energy of the night still echoes with the seething mass of humanity and the heat of the fires from the Man."</p>
