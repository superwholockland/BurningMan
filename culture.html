<h1>Civic Initiatives</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Black Rock Solar</h2>
<p>Black Rock Solar is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that promotes environmental stewardship, economic development and energy independence by providing not-for-profit entities, tribes and underserved communities with access to clean energy, education, and job training.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Burners Without Borders</h2>
<p>Burners Without Borders (BWB) is a grassroots, volunteer-driven, community leadership organization whose goal is to unlock the creativity of local communities to solve problems that bring about meaningful change. Supporting volunteers from around the world in innovative disaster relief solutions & community resiliency projects, BWB is known for the unbridled creativity they bring to every civic project they do.</p>
<p>Following the 2005 Burning Man event, several participants headed south into the Hurricane Katrina disaster area to help people rebuild their devastated communities. As the volunteer numbers grew, they focused their initial efforts on rebuilding a destroyed Vietnamese temple in Biloxi, Mississippi. After several months, that job done, they moved to another needy Mississippi community, Pearlington, to continue to work hard — gifting their time — to help those in need. Over the course of eight months, BWB volunteers gifted over $1 million dollars worth of reconstruction and debris removal to the residents of Mississippi.</p>

<h2>Big Art for Small Towns</h2>
<p>The Black Rock Arts Foundation and Burning Man launched the Big Art for Small Towns initiative in 2012 by collaborating with the city of Fernley, NV on a pilot project, which was awarded a $75,000 grant from the NEA matching other funds raised by BRAF and Burning Man.</p>

<h1>Tech Giants</h1>

<p>According to Fred Turner, a professor of communications at Stanford who has studied Burning Man's appeal for over a decade;</p>
<p>"I think the tech industry and Burning Man have followed parallel trajectories in that both have become suffused with so much money that the countercultural impulses that drove some of their founders have become much harder to see. When I was attending Burning Man in the mid-2000s – which is still 20 years after it started – people went to great pains to make sure the playa was a brand-free environment. They taped over the logos on their U-Hauls, for instance, and staged anti-commercial art works of varying kinds. Some of that is still there, but the last time I went, two years ago, brands were everywhere, famous people were sleeping in camps that they’d paid others to build and maintain, and the original, anti-capitalist edge that I remembered had been ground down to the point of disappearing."</p>
