<h1>Establishment</h1>
<hr>
<p>Black Rock City was originally established as a basecamp when the Burning Man event moved into the Nevada desert. It was necessary to do so because of the several hundred mile trip.</p>
<hr>
<h1>The Shape of the City</h1>
<p>The camp originally formed a circle. “This was not particularly planned, but formed instinctively from the traditional campfire circle and the urge to ‘circle the wagons’ against the nearly boundless space.” “For practical reasons, four avenues were added, indicating the cardinal directions. Compass headings added to the circle served our need to orient ourselves in that stark emptiness.” At the very center of the camp, a hub developed, which centralized all the services and provided a communal gathering area. A zone called “No Man’s Land” was established around “The Man” in order to preserve the view.</p>

<h1>Theme Camps</h1>
<p>A Theme Camp is an interactive camp. Theme Camps are a gift and contribution to the city. Theme Camps are groups of Burning Man participants who come together to provide a service, entertainment, art, or other creative interactive experience for everyone at Burning Man. This interactivity can be truly anything! It’s also the home where camp members sleep, eat, and take care of their needs while living in the desert. Theme Camps began in 1995 and have become the way the majority of people camp and participate in Black Rock City. They are the interactive core of Burning Man. Theme Camps are home to groups of anywhere from six to 400 people. There are also Villages, which are groups of three or more interactive Theme Camps combined together.</p>
