<h2>Crimson Rose, Fire Goddess</h2>
<hr>
<p>Lit the Man in 1991 while performing a fire dance. The fire dancing originated out of necessity, used as a distraction while the pyrotechnic specialists finished up.Fire dancing was originally a specific dance, but as the years went on, it became a form of dance, with dances as varied as the flames.</p>
<p>The Fire Conclave is a composition of select fire performance groups from around the world who create choreography dedicated to honoring the Man. Their performances forge a temporary community, as they offer fire art as a gift in service to the Man. Under the night sky, before the release of the Man in pyrotechnic delight, the largest convergence of fire performers and support staff gather at one time â€” and here, more fire energy is expressed and let loose than anywhere else in the world. Along with the Fire Conclave there are also the Processional Consortium and Ambient Drummers.</p>
<h2>The Processional Consortium</h2>
<hr>
<p>The Processional Consortium is made up of of Luminists, torchbearers who create a path for the Luminferrous to pass; Lamplighters who convey the Luminferrous to the Man; and a processional band who generates energy for the procession. The Processional Consortium transfers the flame from the Cauldron to each fire group in the Fire Conclave, who stand ready to receive the flame.</p>
<h2>Ambient Drummers</h2>
<hr>
<p>The Ambient Drummers are a collection of unaffiliated drummers that help create atmosphere at the foot of the Man on the night of the Burn. Drummers are organized into groups who rehearse together before being distributed around the Great Circle with the Fire Conclave on the night of the Burn to fill the air with music.</p>
